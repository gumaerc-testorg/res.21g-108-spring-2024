In this project, you will create a digital book in Chinese to explore an issue of your choice. You will use [Book Creator](https://bookcreator.com/) to create this book. Your book can include images, texts, videos, and audio.

[This tutorial video](https://intercom.help/bookcreator/en/articles/4143604-book-creator-tutorial-for-%20students) includes instructions on how to log in to Book Creator as a student.

[This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0bWoYdjEfQ) provides information on how to create a book.

## Goal

As Chinese heritage language learners, how can we help bridge the generation and cultural gap in our immigrant families?      

You will create a book to tell a story. You will create the story/narration throughout the semester based on interviews you will conduct with family members or native speakers and research you do throughout the semester.

## Overview

### Can-Do Statements/Learning Objectives

- I can do an oral interview in Chinese.
- I can narrate a story about the topic I chose in written Chinese.
- I can present my findings on the topic orally in Chinese and in a coherent discourse instead of in sentences.
- I can make a logical argument for my topic in Chinese.

### Communicative Modes

- Presentational (speaking and writing)
- Interpretive (listening, reading online research)
- Interpersonal (speaking and listening)

### Delivery Modes

- Asynchronous: Once you publish your book, you will share its URL on the discussion board. 
- Synchronous: Based on your book, you will give a final oral presentation.

### Estimated time

The project is for the whole semester. You will complete it in three stages.
