## Goal

As Chinese heritage language learners, how can we help bridge the generation and cultural gap in our immigrant families?      

You will create a book to tell a story. You will create the story/narration throughout the semester based on interviews you will conduct with family members or native speakers and research you do throughout the semester.

## Overview

### Can-Do Statements/Learning Objectives

- I can do an oral interview in Chinese.
- I can narrate a story about the topic I chose in written Chinese.
- I can present my findings on the topic orally in Chinese and in a coherent discourse instead of in sentences.
- I can make a logical argument for my topic in Chinese.

### Communicative Modes

- Presentational (speaking and writing)
- Interpretive (listening, reading online research)
- Interpersonal (speaking and listening)

### Delivery Modes

- Asynchronous: Once you publish your book, you will share its URL on the discussion board. 
- Synchronous: Based on your book, you will give a final oral presentation.

### Estimated time

The project is for the whole semester. You will complete it in three stages.
